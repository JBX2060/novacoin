# Building GUI and headless client for Ubuntu Linux

## Preparations

First step, install all dependencies:

    ```sudo apt install build-essential libdb++-dev libssl-dev cmake qtdeclarative5-dev qttools5-dev libboost-all-dev libpng-dev libdeflate-dev git```

Then, clone repository recursively:

    ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/novacoin-project/novacoin```

## Building GUI client

Create build directory:

    ```mkdir novacoin/build_qt && cd novacoin/build_qt```

Configure build files:

    ```cmake -DUSE_LEVELDB=1 ..```

You may specify BDB library path, if necessary:

    ```cmake -DBerkeleyDB_LIBS=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/ -DUSE_LEVELDB=1 ..```

Compile:

    ```make -j 4```

After everything will be done the resulting ```novacoin-qt``` executable will be created in your build directory.

## Building headless client

It's almost identical to steps for GUI client.

Create build directory:

    ```mkdir novacoin/build_daemon && cd novacoin/build_daemon```

Configure build files:

    ```cmake -DUSE_LEVELDB=1 ../src```

Compile:

    ```make -j 4```

The resulting ```novacoind``` executable will be created in the build directory.
